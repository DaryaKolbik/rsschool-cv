## Briefly about myself ##
Being always opened for new opportunities and experience I've decided to explore myself in programming. Thanks to free access to  proficient courses and Youtube blogs as well as to opened developers community the studying process is proper and immersive to IT-sphere even for me, as mom of preschooler and person from another business area (transport and logistics). So I'm motivated, well-organized, responsible and result-oriented. I have analitycal thinking and wish to see immediate realization of own work. That is why I estimate  Front-End Development as appropriate profession for me.
